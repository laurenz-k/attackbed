# Ansible Role OpenSearch

This roll installs opensearch as a single-node-instance.
It is a modified fork of the [official opensearch ansible role](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ansible-playbook).
Checkout the CHANGELOG.txt for all changes.

**Please note that this modified version is not meant for production use!**

### Prerequisite

- **Ansible 2.9+**
- **Java 8**

# Requirements

This role was tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Other linux distributions might work as well.
The original role sets the hostname and `/etc/hosts`. This fork does not set the hostname
and requires another role for that like  https://github.com/ait-testbed/atb-ansible-hostname.

### Minimum hardware requirements:

- Memory: min. 8GB RAM or more
- CPU: 2 cores or more
